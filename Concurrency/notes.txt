cpu = central processing unit
each processsor has a number of cores

amount of cores on computer = amount of things that can happen concurrently at same time
e.g if cpu has 4 cores --> we can do 4 operations at same time

parallelism - idea of multiple operations happening at same time
clock speed - a rate of operations EACH CORE can run per second

a cpu has a number of cores
the number of cores dictates how many parallel operations can happen at same time 

thread - one program/set of operations
each thread is assigned to a core 
threading - function to determine sequence of how to run threads 
  - threading can happpen on one core or several 
  - not happening in parallel 
  - usefulness - when a thread is hanging/waiting core can run another thread 

concurrent programming - idea of threading and executing operations in different sequeunces 
parallism - executing operations at the same time 

threads get distributed among the cpu cores 
each core can do one thing at a time 

threading - distributing processes between threads for the core 
- enables concurrent running if one thread becomes idle/hangs

core able to go in between threads as to not pause a process if one is hanging
